## Session Summary

### Completed Tasks
1. Created deployment automation demo project
2. Built AI knowledge base at `/home/meep/`
3. Consolidated startup scripts from 5 → 4 files
4. Analyzed and optimized bash startup system

### Key Decisions
- Kept AGENTS.md and OPENCODE.md as separate canonical files
- Chose Option 3 (multiple context files) over RAG for context expansion
- Consolidated startup scripts with numbered naming convention

### Lessons Applied
- Bun package manager: faster than npm
- Plan-first approach: kept execution focused
- Knowledge base: persists across sessions via `/home/meep/`
